**Location:** `demochat`

**Video:** [demo video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqnFKw6PUHk)

**Key Features:**
- This demo demonstrates how to build healthcare AI agents with PhenoML (see: `demochat/build_agents.ipynb`) and how they can be accessible via demo chat apps. 
- Running this demo requires a phenoml subscription. If you're interested in more granular agent customization check out a [reference example](https://github.com/PhenoML/phenoml_workshop_a2a_mcp) of how to build agents using our lang2FHIR API tools. 
- An example using a phenoml agent as a "bring your own LLM" with Vapi to add voice to your phenoml agent is demonstrated! See reference documentation from Vapi on connecting Vapi to a custom LLM [here](https://github.com/VapiAI/example-server-python-flask/blob/main/app/api/custom_llm.py). The voice agent is purely demonstrative and NOT intended for sensitive or production usage.
